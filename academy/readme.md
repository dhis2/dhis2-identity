### DHIS2 Academy Identity
---
These guidelines exist to ensure consistent communication with the DHIS2 and DHIS2 Academy brand. There are some rules and some recommendations. This is a living document that will be updated as the brand evolves. Please reach out if there are elements that are missing.

*Please note: The DHIS2 Academy Identity applies for both the DHIS2 Academies and the DHIS2 Online Academy. The academy type should be specified elsewhere in the text/website/information, not in the logo itself.*

*Please send all DHIS2 Academy materials to alice@dhis2.org for approval before using.*

# Logo
## Master Logo
![dhis2 Academy master logo][masterLogoAca]

The master DHIS2 Academy logo should be used overall, whenever possible. The master logo is a blue colored icon with black colored dhis2 wordmark and a grey colored Academy wordmark.

## Logo Variations
### Reversed Logo
![dhis2 Academy reversed logo][reversedLogoAca]

When placing the DHIS2 logo on a dark background, the reversed version can be used. The icon and wordmarks are white in this version. The reversed logo can be placed on any colored background, but ideally blue would be used to remain consistent with the DHIS2 brand.

### Icon Only
Where there is insufficient room for the full logo, use the Icon only version instead. This logo is supplied in the main [DHIS2 Identity Guidelines](https://github.com/dhis2/dhis2-identity#icon-only).

# Best practices
Follow these guidelines when using the DHIS2 Academy logo to ensure consistency and reliability across all DHIS2 Academy materials. Using consistent branding everywhere makes DHIS2 and DHIS2 Academy more trustworthy and accessible for all.

### Do: Use the offical logo files
The official DHIS2 Academy logos can be downloaded in various formats from this repo. Use these files in all materials, do not recreate the logo or icon.<br>
![Example logo in use][logo-pass-1]

### Do: Give the logo plenty of space
Try to always give the logo breathing room when placed next to other elements. As a general rule, provide space of at least the height of the 2 from the logo.<br>
![Example logo in use][logo-pass-2]

### Do: Use the correct logo for the background
Whenever possible, on all light backgrounds, use the full color logo. Only use the reversed (all-white) version of the logo on dark backgrounds.<br>
![Example logo in use][logo-pass-3]

### Don't: Change the color of any of the text
![Example logo in use][logo-fail-1]
### Don't: Change the layout of the text and/or icon
![Example logo in use][logo-fail-2]
### Don't: Change the color of the icon
![Example logo in use][logo-fail-3]
### Don't: Add other text to the logo
Special events/other departments should not add their taglines/names to the DHIS2 logo. Special events can be noted in their own way, eg. with a unique, non-DHIS2 logo.<br>
![Example logo in use][logo-fail-4]
### Don't: Add visual effects to the logo
Drop-shadows, outlines, borders and other effects should not be used. If the logo is not clear, try modifying the background or using another version of the DHIS2 logo.<br>
![Example logo in use][logo-fail-5]
### Don't: Remove parts of the logo
The logo should always be used in full. Limited space? Try using the icon-only version.<br>
![Example logo in use][logo-fail-6]
### Don't: Add other shapes to the logo
![Example logo in use][logo-fail-7]
