### DHIS2 Identity Guidelines
---
These guidelines exist to ensure consistent communication with the DHIS2 brand. There are some rules and some recommendations. This is a living document that will be updated as the brand evolves. Please reach out if there are elements that are missing.

# Logo
## Master Logo
![dhis2 master logo][masterLogo]

The master DHIS2 logo should be used overall, whenever possible. The master logo is a blue colored icon with black colored dhis2 wordmark.

## Logo Variations
### Reversed Logo
![dhis2 reversed logo][reversedLogo]

When placing the DHIS2 logo on a dark background, the reversed version can be used. The icon and wordmark are white in this version. The reversed logo can be placed on any colored background, but ideally blue would be used to remain consistent with the DHIS2 brand.

### Icon only
![dhis2 icon only examples][iconCombo]

There are times when it makes sense to use only the DHIS2 icon, such as in headers, toolbars and app icons. There are both blue colored and white colored icons, and these should be used as the main logo is used – blue colored where possible and white colored on darker backgrounds.

# Typography
### Communication
![dhis2 Typography][typo]

The same font should be used across all communication platforms: DHIS2 website, academy materials etc (but not in software interface). The font used is the open-source Rubik from Google Fonts. [Download Rubik](https://github.com/dhis2/identity/tree/master/fonts) 

Note: Rubik font should not be used in software interfaces (eg. in the main DHIS2 apps), it is the specified as DHIS2 typography for external elements only.


### DHIS2 Logo
The font used in the DHIS2 logo is the open-source Karla from Google Fonts. Always use the premade DHIS2 logos, do not create new logos using text. The font file and license are stored in this repository, if needed.

# Color

Color is used sparingly throughout DHIS2 materials. The DHIS2 style is clean and fresh, color should therefore be used only as a supporting element and not as the main element.

The following colors can be used throughout materials both digital and print. See Examples in Use for suggestions for color use. 
      
### White

![Color: White](https://github.com/dhis2/dhis2-identity/blob/exampleUpdates/guide%20assets/accentWhite.png?raw=true "Color White")

`HEX: #FFFFFF`
`RGB: 255 / 255 / 255`
`CMYK:  0 / 0 / 0 / 0`

Is white a color? The debate rages on. White is listed here at the top of this list to reiterate how important the usage of white space is in the DHIS2 identity. White space on posters, presentations and other materials communicates DHIS2 as a clean, confident and modern entity, an important part of the new identity. Do not be afriad to leave generous white space in all materials. The main color of most DHIS2 materials should be white.

      
### DHIS2 Accent

![Color: Accent](https://github.com/dhis2/dhis2-identity/blob/exampleUpdates/guide%20assets/accent.png?raw=true "Color Accent")

`HEX: #43CBCB`
`RGB: 67 / 203 / 203`
`CMYK:  62 / 0 / 26 / 0`
`Pantone 2397 C`

This accent color works well for small graphic elements, bringing an interesting visual element to the otherwise white, clean materials. This color is best used in moderation, it works well when used to thin divider elements or headers/footers. The white (negative) DHIS2 logo should not be placed on top of this color, instead use DHIS2 Accent Dark. 

      
### DHIS2 Accent Light

![Color: Accent Light](https://github.com/dhis2/dhis2-identity/blob/exampleUpdates/guide%20assets/accentLight.png?raw=true "Color Accent Light")

`HEX: #D8F7F7`
`RGB: 216 / 247 / 247`
`CMYK:  13 / 0 / 4 / 0`
`Pantone 7457 C (Note: not a great match, use CMYK where possible)`

A lighter shade of the accent color is provided for use in larger areas where the DHIS2 Accent color is too overwhelming. This color can be used behind titles to create eye-catching blocks of text. This light color is suited for used with graphical elements, placing them as background graphics that are not too distracting.


### DHIS2 Accent Dark

![Color: Accent Dark](https://github.com/dhis2/dhis2-identity/blob/exampleUpdates/guide%20assets/accentDark.png?raw=true "Color Accent Dark")

`HEX: #393D4D`
`RGB: 57 / 61 / 77`
`CMYK:  77 / 69 / 48 / 40`
`Pantone 7546 C`

This dark color is great for use as a background in situations where a white background is not suitable. This darker color is more traditional and safe than the other accent colors, so is better suited to use in areas where a traditional approach is necessary. This color is less fun and accessible, and communicates seriousness and stability. This color works well with the white (negative) version of the DHIS2 logo.


### DHIS2 Accent Alt

![Color: Accent Alt](https://github.com/dhis2/dhis2-identity/blob/exampleUpdates/guide%20assets/accentAlt.png?raw=true "Color Accent Alt")

`HEX: #FF8F02`
`RGB: 255 / 143 / 2`
`CMYK:  0 / 53 / 100 / 0`
`Pantone 144 C`

An alternative accent color that should rarely be used. This bright, eye-catching color can be used in designs where an extra color element is needed, however it should be handled with care as it can quickly overwhelm a design. One area it could work, for example, is the color of bullet points on a DHIS2 poster. The orange color should never be used as a background, or placed behind the DHIS2 logo.

### DHIS2 Legacy Blue

![Color: Accent Alt](https://github.com/dhis2/dhis2-identity/blob/exampleUpdates/guide%20assets/legacyBlue.png?raw=true "Color Accent Alt")

`HEX: #276696`
`RGB: 39 / 102 / 150`
`CMYK:  89 / 59 / 20 / 3`
`Pantone 7692 C`

This blue was often used as part of the previous DHIS2 identity, but it should now be phased out of usage. Instead, the colors outlined above should be used in the style of the examples below. If legacy materials need to be updated, the above Legacy Blue can be used. This color should not be used in completely new applications.

### DHIS2 logo blue?
The blue color used in the DHIS2 logo icon is purposefully not included here. This blue color should be used only for the logo icon, never in any other way. It is important for recognisability, consistency and stability that this blue color is only associated with the DHIS2 logo.

# Graphic Elements

In order for DHIS2 to communicate its flexibility, graphic elements are kept ambiguious and avoid associating with any particular industry (for example; healthcare). The following graphic elements are based on the forms and angles that make up the DHIS2 logo.

![graphic example][graphicExample]

### Oblong shape
The oblong shape that makes up the DHIS2 logo can be used to create a graphic pattern that adds interest and personality in an ambigous way. The soft edges communicate an approachable system. This graphic pattern is available in this repository in several different formats, sizes and types for use in presentations, documents and other materials. 

#### Usage
The pattern is best used at the bottom, or sides of a document/signage. The pattern is available in different types: block, which has hard egdes, and faded, which fades the pattern gradually to transparent.

See the below Examples in Use for further suggestions for usage. Templates are provided in this repository for common formats.

### DHIS2 Icon
The DHIS2 icon used in the logo should not be used as a graphical element. It can be used as a logo, but it should not be used large, repeated as a pattern or altered in any way. Remember, the integrity of the DHIS2 is essential to stability of DHIS2's communication.

# Best practices
Follow these guidelines when using the DHIS2 logo to ensure consistency and reliability across all DHIS2 materials. Using consistent branding everywhere makes DHIS2 more trustworthy and accessible for all.

### Do: Use the offical logo files
The official DHIS2 logos can be downloaded in various formats from this repo. Use these files in all materials, do not recreate the logo or icon.
![Example logo in use][logo-pass-1]

### Do: Give the logo plenty of space
Try to always give the logo breathing room when placed next to other elements. As a general rule, provide space of at least the height of the 2 from the logo.
![Example logo in use][logo-pass-2]

### Do: Use the correct logo for the background
Whenever possible, on all light backgrounds, use the full color logo. Only use the reversed (all-white) version of the logo on dark backgrounds.

### Don't: Change the color of any of the text
![Example logo in use][logo-fail-1]
### Don't: Change the layout of the text and/or icon
![Example logo in use][logo-fail-2]
### Don't: Change the color of the icon
![Example logo in use][logo-fail-3]
### Don't: Add other text to the logo
Special events/other departments should not add their taglines/names to the DHIS2 logo. Special events can be noted in their own way, eg. with a unique, non-DHIS2 logo.
![Example logo in use][logo-fail-4]
### Don't: Add visual effects to the logo
Drop-shadows, outlines, borders and other effects should not be used. If the logo is not clear, try modifying the background or using another version of the DHIS2 logo.
![Example logo in use][logo-fail-5]
### Don't: Remove parts of the logo
The logo should always be used in full. Limited space? Try using the icon-only version.
![Example logo in use][logo-fail-6]
### Don't: Add other shapes to the logo
